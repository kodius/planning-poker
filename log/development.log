DEPRECATION WARNING: Method first is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1, as `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from hash. Using this deprecated behavior exposes potential security problems. If you continue to use this method you may be creating a security vulnerability in your app that can be exploited. Instead, consider using one of these documented methods which are not deprecated: http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.7/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html (called from create at /Users/tinilijas/Desktop/Dev/planning-poker-master/app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb:28)
